1. Project Description
----------------------

The platform and application support an environment for software developers which utilizes a volunteer's 
machine resources (authorized by the user) to execute developer's software and providing software execution 
reports. These reports can then be used by the developer to make the software more robust resulting in less 
maintenance time after the product's launch.



1.1. Project Audience
---------------------

The focus of the project is to provide vastly resource scenarios to application developers, mainly for 
independent developers or small developing companies which do not have enough resources to test their 
software before release. 



1.2. Project Data Flow
----------------------

1.	Developer upload its application into the JusTi solution.
2.	Users decide to join application development by downloading developer's application, installing and 
executing in their environment (computing resources).
3.	Application collects execution logs and send them to JusTi log database.
4.	Develop is able to download its application's log from JusTi database.



1.3. Project Resources
----------------------

- Java
- MySQL
- Hadoop
- HBase
